# Python Football - Data Analysis with NumPy

This project demonstrates the use of NumPy for data analysis in Python, focusing on arrays and their operations. The examples include creating arrays, performing numerical computations, and working with goalkeeper data such as names, heights, and weights.

## Features
- Creating and manipulating NumPy arrays.
- Generating arrays with zeros, ones, and random values.
- Performing operations like finding maximum values and their indices.
- Combining and analyzing data using NumPy.

## Latest Updates

### Data Analysis Part One: NumPy
The `arrays_in_numpy.ipynb` notebook introduces the basics of creating and manipulating NumPy arrays. Key highlights include:
- Generating arrays with zeros, ones, and random values.
- Performing operations like finding maximum values and their indices.
- Combining and analyzing data using NumPy.

The `indexing_numpy_arrays.ipynb` notebook demonstrates various techniques for indexing and manipulating NumPy arrays. Key highlights include:
- Creating and modifying arrays of World Cup years.
- Using bracket selection for accessing specific elements.
- Combining arrays into 2D structures for easier indexing.
- Applying conditional selection to filter data based on criteria.

Refer to these notebooks for detailed examples and code snippets.
