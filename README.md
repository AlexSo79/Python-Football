# Python Football - Data Analysis with NumPy

This project demonstrates the use of NumPy for data analysis in Python, focusing on arrays and their operations. The examples include creating arrays, performing numerical computations, and working with goalkeeper data such as names, heights, and weights.

## Features
- Creating and manipulating NumPy arrays.
- Generating arrays with zeros, ones, and random values.
- Performing operations like finding maximum values and their indices.
- Combining and analyzing data using NumPy.

## Source
This project is inspired by tutorials from [FC Python](https://fcpython.com/), a site dedicated to teaching Python for football analytics.

## Files
- **Data Analysis Part One NumPy/arrays_in_numpy.ipynb**: A Jupyter Notebook containing the code examples and explanations.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- NumPy library

## Usage
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook file in your preferred environment.
3. Run the cells to explore and understand NumPy operations.
